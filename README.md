#HTML-CSS-Javascript Demo

This is a basic project that gives a demo of how HTML, CSS and Javascript work in a web page.

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text markup Language.. It gives structure to webpages by making use of HTML elements. In this project, we use HTML elements to create box container within which we create a heading, paragraphs, a button and lists elememts.

2. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It enhances the visual look and presentation of HTML pages. In this project, we used CSS to center the box in the web page, add a background-color to the box, change the font-family of the web page, style the button etc..

3. Javascript is a high-level programming language to adds interactivity into the webpage. In this project, we used Javascript in such a way that if one mouse over the HTML header, the texts changes and whenever we click on the button, it adds a new list item.
